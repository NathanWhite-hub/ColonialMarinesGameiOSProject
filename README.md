# ColonialMarinesGameiOSProject
In 2015 while in my iOS development class, our final project was to create an app on an iOS device which could be anything we wanted with a deadline of two weeks. For the next two weeks I spent countless hours programming away at this app. I haven't touched this code in six years, but I am still proud of what I made then, especially being in High School.

This project was created with the IDE Xcode. The front end UI was created with Xcode's UI features and the backend logic was written in Objective-C. Abrstraction was extremely important here due to the amount of backend logic running my decision tree design. While also writing the code, I created background design and UI elements in Photoshop to have it stand out and give credence to the Aliens franchise's industrial futuristic aesthetic.

I recall the game being fairly short, which is due to the limited development time and my inability to write a length story within that time. I recieved praise from my instructor and a letter of recommendation from him due to this project.
